# Klavis_AI_Assignment

## Assignment:

Thank you for your interest in the Founding Engineer role at Klavis AI. We really appreciate you taking the time to connect with us.

As the next step in our evaluation process, we have a take-home coding assignment. This is our primary method for understanding how you approach problems, design systems, and write code. For a foundational role like this, seeing your work in a practical context is more valuable to us than a series of abstract technical questions.

This task is designed to simulate the real-world work you would be doing: expanding the Klavis AI ecosystem.

The Assignment
Your task is to build a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for a public API of your choice.

Choose an Integration (pick one service):

Google Flights – Flight search and booking
Miro – Visual collaboration
Intercom – Customer messaging
AgentMail – AI email assistant
Amplitude – Digital analytics
Box – Cloud content management
Reddit – Social news aggregation
Sentry – Error monitoring
Paddle – Payment processing and billing
Browserbase – Browser automation
Build the Server:
Using the attached General Guidelines for Building Custom MCP Servers for Klavis AI, develop a new server that exposes useful, atomic tools for your chosen API.

Submit Your Work:
Submit your completed server as a Pull Request to our open-source GitHub repository: https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis

Please Read Carefully: Important Considerations & Our Commitment to Transparency
We are asking you to contribute to our open-source project as part of this evaluation. We believe in complete transparency, so we want to be upfront about the nature of this assignment and what it does—and does not—imply. Please consider the following points carefully before you decide to proceed.

On "Free Labor"
We recognize that this task provides value to our project. Our intention is not to get free work. It is to create the most realistic and effective evaluation for a founding role. This assignment allows us to assess your product sense in designing tools, your coding standards, and your ability to work within our project's framework. We believe this is a better indicator of success than a whiteboard algorithm.

On Licensing, Ownership, and the Future of the Project
This is the most important point.

Your contribution must be submitted under the MIT License, which is the current license for the entire repository.
The MIT license is permissive. It means that while you retain the copyright to your original work, you grant us (and anyone else) a permanent, irrevocable right to use, modify, and incorporate your contribution into other works for any purpose, including in commercial, closed-source products.
To be completely transparent, we reserve the right to change the licensing model for the project in the future. This means we could take the entire repository private and continue its development as a proprietary, closed-source product. The MIT license under which you are contributing explicitly gives us the right to incorporate your code into such a product. The version of the code you contributed will, however, always remain available under the terms of the MIT license to anyone who has a copy from the time it was public.
We are telling you this directly because we believe in full transparency and want to ensure you are comfortable with this commercial reality before investing your time.
A Merged PR Does Not Guarantee a Job Offer
All submissions will be reviewed.
A merged PR = positive signal, but not an automatic next round or offer.
We are hiring only a few Founding Engineers from many applicants.
Submission Deadline
Please submit your Pull Request within one week after receiving this email.
If you need an extension, let us know in advance.

Best regards,
The Klavis AI Team
